# aplib.py
Python implementation of an aPLib decompressor

This is a hack of a hack of https://code.google.com/p/kabopan/source/browse/trunk/kbp/comp/aplib.py which has been modified for Python 3 and made super verbose. It simply adds some (possibly correct) documentation of the compression format and some rather verbose logging of the data in a compressed stream while decoding. The compression functionality could come back.
