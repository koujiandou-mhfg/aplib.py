# aplib.py
Python implementatin of an aPLib decompressor

This is a hack of a hack of https://code.google.com/p/kabopan/source/browse/trunk/kbp/comp/aplib.py whic, modified for Python 3 and made super verbose. It simplyadds some (possibly correct) documentation of the compression format and some rather verbose logging of the data in a compressed stream while decoding. The encoding could come back.
